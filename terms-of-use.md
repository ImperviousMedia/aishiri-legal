# Aishiri Terms of Use

Last updated: 2025-12-19

These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your use of the Renka mobile application (“Renka,” “we,” “us”). By using Renka, you agree to these Terms.

## 1. What Aishiri Does
Renka helps users correlate anime episodes and manga chapters, track progress, and optionally use “Lore Mode” features.

## 2. Accounts
Some features require an account (for example: saving progress, comments, and cross-device sync). You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials.

## 3. Subscriptions and Payments (Lore Mode)
Aishiri may offer auto-renewable subscriptions (for example: “Lore Mode Monthly” and “Lore Mode Yearly”).

- Payment is charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase.
- Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.
- Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.
- You can manage or cancel subscriptions in your device settings:
  Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions
- If a free trial is offered (if applicable), any unused portion is forfeited when you purchase a subscription.

Prices may vary by region and are shown in-app at time of purchase.

## 4. Acceptable Use
You agree not to:
- misuse the app, attempt unauthorized access, or interfere with systems,
- reverse engineer the app except where permitted by law,
- use the service for illegal activity.

## 5. User Content (if you enable comments/community)
If Aishiri allows comments or posts:
- You are responsible for what you submit.
- You grant Renka a limited license to host and display your content inside the app for operation of the service.
- We may remove content that violates these Terms or applicable policies.

## 6. Third-Party Services
Aishiri may rely on third-party services (such as Apple services, Firebase, and AI providers) to operate. Their use may be subject to their own terms and policies.

## 7. Disclaimers
Aishiri is provided “as is.” We do not guarantee accuracy of mappings, AI-generated explanations, or availability without interruption.

## 8. Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by law, Aishiri will not be liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the app.

## 9. Changes
We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use after changes means you accept the updated Terms.
